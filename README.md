**No quiz ID needed · No paywall · No server · BYO API key · Works on any live game**

> ⚠️ **Requires the host to have "Show questions & answers on players devices" enabled in Kahoot settings.** This is on by default for most games. If the host disables it, the extension has no question data to work with.

## ⚡ What Makes This Different

Most Kahoot tools only handle basic multiple-choice. Some need the Quiz ID beforehand. Others hide behind a paywall or shared server that gets rate-limited.

**kaBot works on every question type Kahoot offers**, answers in real-time during live games, and runs entirely on your own OpenAI key — no middleman, no limits, no accounts.

## 🧠 Supported Question Types

### 📝 Multiple Choice & True/False
Reads the question and all choices from the WebSocket, sends to GPT, highlights and clicks the correct answer. Handles image-based choices by reading `aria-label` attributes.

### ☑️ Multi-Select
Evaluates each option independently using a YES/NO per-option prompt strategy. Filters out fabricated or nonsensical choices and selects all correct answers — typically 2-4 out of the options.

### 📍 Pin-It (Map & Image Questions)
Sends the image to **GPT-4.1 Vision** with a detailed coordinate system and landmark reference points for world maps. Places the pin on the correct location via SVG coordinate injection. *No other Kahoot tool does this.*

### 🧩 Jumble (Reorder)
Reads shuffled tiles, asks GPT for the correct order, computes the tile permutation mapping, then simulates drag-and-click reordering through React's virtual DOM — including fiber tree manipulation for React state updates.

### 🎚️ Slider (Numeric)
Asks GPT the factual question, snaps the answer to the nearest valid step value using offset math (`min + round((value - min) / step) * step`), sends the WS answer during the loading animation for speed, then sets the visual slider and clicks submit.

### ✏️ Open-Ended (Type Answer)
Generates a short answer within the character limit, types it character-by-character with simulated keyboard events (keydown → InputEvent → keyup) to work with React controlled inputs, then submits.

## 🛠️ Installation

### From Source (Recommended)

1. **Download** — Clone or download this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gavri-dev/kaBot.git
   ```

2. **Load in Chrome**
   - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer Mode** (top right toggle)
   - Click **Load unpacked**
   - Select the `kaBot` folder

3. **Add your API key**
   - Click the extension icon in Chrome
   - Expand the OpenAI settings
   - Paste your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Model defaults to `gpt-5-mini` (fast + cheap), but you can use any model

4. **Join a Kahoot game** — the extension activates automatically on `kahoot.it`

## ⚙️ Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Highlight Answer** | ✅ On | Visually highlights the correct answer with a green glow |
| **Auto-Click** | ✅ On | Automatically clicks/submits the answer |

```

**How it works:**

1. **`injected.js`** hooks into the page's WebSocket and intercepts question data as Kahoot sends it to the client — before the UI even renders
2. **`content.js`** enriches the question (image labels, slider config from DOM) and sends it to the service worker
3. **`autoresponder.js`** routes it to the correct handler in **`openai.js`** based on question type
4. The AI response flows back through the chain: service worker → content script → injected script → DOM manipulation + WS submission

**Speed optimizations:**
- Questions are sent to AI the instant they arrive via WebSocket — during the loading animation
- Slider and jumble answers are sent via WS before the UI is interactive
- Pin placement starts polling for the SVG at 100ms intervals, not waiting for any buffer

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Your API key stays local** — stored in Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync`, never sent anywhere except OpenAI
- **No external servers** — zero backend, no analytics, no telemetry
- **No data collection** — the extension doesn't log or transmit anything
- **Minimal permissions** — only `storage` and access to `kahoot.it` and `api.openai.com`

---

## 💰 API Cost

Using `gpt-5-mini` (default), a typical 20-question Kahoot game costs roughly **$0.01-0.03** in API credits. Pin-it questions cost slightly more (~$0.02 each) because they use `gpt-4.1` for vision.
